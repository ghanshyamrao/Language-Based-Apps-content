        "description1": "With over 30 years in the construction industry and more than $200 million in completed development projects across the Greater Montreal area, GAHQ was built on deep roots in Quebec's residential and commercial property sectors. We've worked throughout the North Shore, South Shore, West Island, and everywhere in between.",
        "description2": "GAHQ was born from what we kept seeing: homeowners overwhelmed by basic repairs, unsure where to turn for honest advice, and stuck in endless contractor runarounds. We knew there had to be a better way — one that made homeownership easier, not harder.",
        "description3": "That's why we created GAHQ: a platform that connects you with a trusted network of certified contractors, reliable service providers, and insurance claims experts. When you become a member, you gain access to this entire ecosystem.",
        "description4": "Our team includes licensed building professionals, AMF-certified insurance advisors, and specialists in home damage assessment, post-sinister repairs, and claim negotiations. Whether you need help filing an insurance claim, managing renovations, or just keeping your home in shape, we're here to support you — with integrity, efficiency, and the knowledge that comes from decades on the ground."
